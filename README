## Objective
This project analyzes how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed index) relates to trader behavior and performance on Hyperliquid. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns and derive actionable trading insights.

## Dataset Description

1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset  
   Columns: timestamp, value, classification, date  
   Frequency: Daily  

2. Hyperliquid Historical Trader Data  
   Includes: Account, Execution Price, Size USD, Side, Closed PnL, Timestamp, etc.  

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded both datasets using pandas
- Checked missing values and duplicates
- Converted timestamps to datetime
- Aligned both datasets at daily frequency
- Filtered overlapping date range (Jan 2023 – May 2025)

### 2. Feature Engineering
Created daily account-level metrics:
- Daily PnL per trader
- Number of trades per day
- Daily win rate
- Long/short ratio
- Sentiment regime classification (Fear vs Greed)

Segmented traders by frequency:
- High Frequency (above median trades/day)
- Low Frequency (below median trades/day)

### 3. Analysis
Compared:
- Mean and median PnL
- Win rate
- Trade frequency
- PnL volatility (risk proxy)
Across:
- Fear vs Greed regimes
- High vs Low frequency segments

## Key Insights

### 1. Fear Regimes Generate Higher Returns but Higher Risk
- Highest average PnL observed during Fear
- However, volatility also significantly higher
- Performance driven by large outlier wins

### 2. Greed Regimes Offer More Consistent Returns
- Higher median PnL
- Slightly higher win rate
- Lower volatility than Fear

### 3. High-Frequency Traders Exploit Fear Volatility
- Earn highest returns in Fear regime
- Accept lower win rate but capture large moves
- Risk-return profile significantly stronger than Low-Frequency traders

### 4. Directional Bias Does Not Shift Strongly with Sentiment
- Long/short ratio remains near 50/50 across regimes
- Suggests short-term or neutral trading strategies dominate

## Strategy Recommendations

### Strategy 1: Volatility Allocation Rule
During Fear regimes:
- Increase capital allocation to high-frequency traders
- Reduce exposure to low-frequency traders

### Strategy 2: Risk Control During Greed
During Greed regimes:
- Cap leverage for high-frequency traders
- Reduce aggressive trade sizing
